Description: Ansible Runner HTTP Event Emitter
 This project is a plugin for Ansible Runner that allows emitting Ansible
 status and events to HTTP services in the form of POST events. This can
 allow Runner to notify other systems as Ansible jobs are run and to
 deliver key events to that system if it's interested.
